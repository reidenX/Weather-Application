# Weather App

This project was made with react.

## What I've learned

how to use useState from React and call an Api. I also understood more about the difference between a norman function and an arrow function. I know it's a bit irrelivant but I just wanna put it out there.

## What are my future plans for this project?
I really wanted to include a google map but it's actually harder than I thougt. But I am looking forward to learn more about it and hopefully add it to this project.

## What I used?
* Html
* Css
* Javascript
* React
